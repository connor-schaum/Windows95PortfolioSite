I worked on a small indie game with a couple friends from my MS program at Georgia Tech. We build a fishing game in Unity using C#. The goal of the game
is to work your way through different biomes catching all the rare and flashy fish that exist while keeping the hungry bear fed. The player goes through
each biome upgrading their stats to eventually catch the boss fish (THE MEGLADON! lol). It was a really fun introduction to making games and it's something
I'll come back to to look at for good memories. In addition to some of the more basic qualities of the game (fishing and upgrading) there is also an AI component
with both AI fish and AI enemies that travel around the map using different pre-baked and computational NavMeshes. The AI components offer a little more
dynamic action to each biome and I had a great time making them. - Watch out for the Bees!
