Hey! My name is Connor Schaum. I am a 1st year MS student at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science with a specialization in Computing Systems. 
This site is a small, interactive space where I've showcased a couple projects I've worked on over the years, along with things I'm currently exploring. Feel
free to click around and experiement with the interface.
Serveral option in the start menu are active - most notibly Settings, where you can adjust the wallpaper, time display, and font size.
I'll continue adding images and updates over time. For now, you'll find written project descriptions and in-game screenshots from an indie game I worked on
over the summer.
